    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is an EIN? What is a Tax ID Number? Are they the same thing?</strong></span></p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">There are a few different names that all refer to the same 9 digit number that all entities must obtain from the IRS in order to start a business. The IRS assigned these numbers through an application process, and the format of the number is like this: 12-3456789. Below are the acronyms and names for this IRS assigned 9 digit number:</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to federal taxes and the requirements of businesses and entities, it can get very confusing. Gov Doc Filing aims to simplify the process for you by being your go-to resource of tax, IRS, and business information, as well as help you with the filing processes of creating and <a href="https://www.govdocfiling.com/faq/how-do-i-get-an-ein-application">obtaining an EIN number</a> and the next steps in business formation.</p>
    <ul>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Tax ID Number</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">TIN – stands for Tax ID Number</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">EIN – stands for Employer Identification Number</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">FEIN – stands for Federal Employer Identification Number</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Federal Tax ID</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Federal TIN – stands for Federal Tax ID Number</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align: left;">The most common names are EIN and Tax ID, and again they are the same thing, even if you do not have to plan to have any employees. EINs/Tax ID numbers are used to identify a business entities, and additional entities like Estates or Trusts, similar to the way you, as an individual, would be identified by your social security number. Businesses generally are required to have an EIN.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Choosing the proper entity is important and can determine many things, including how much you get taxed on profits, how you or your company will be treated in a lawsuit, and the type of bank account you’ll be able to open.</p>

          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How do I Apply for a Tax ID Number (EIN)</strong></span></p>
          <p>There are 3 steps to obtaining your federal EIN:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Select your entity type</li>
            <li>Fill out the information on the simplified one page form (SS-4).</li>
            <li>Submit&nbsp;a one time federal filing fee for one hour processing</li>
          </ol>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When will I receive my Tax ID and when will I be able to use it?</strong></span></p>
          <p>You will receive your Tax ID number from the IRS within 1 hour of submitting your online TIN application through the website. Gov Doc Filing is committed to processing EIN Applications quickly and accurately so that you can start to use your EIN and get along with your business needs! You will receive your Tax ID to the e-mail submitted in the EIN online form. The EIN can be used immediate for most of your business needs, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Opening a bank account</li>
            <li>Apply for a business license in your state</li>
            <li>File a tax return by mail</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Yet it can take up to 2 weeks for the Tax ID to become a part of the official IRS records. You may have to wait until you can use your Employer Identification Number to file an <a href="https://www.govdocfiling.com/entity-classification-election">electronic tax return</a>, make an e-payment, or pass an IRS Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching program.</p>
          <p>Please note that different banks have different requirements. Some banks may require the official letter from the IRS, which gets sent to the address provided in the online Tax ID Application. This can take up to 4 weeks to arrive.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What entity type is right for me?</strong></span></p>
          <p>The absolute first step in starting your business is deciding which entity type is right for your business. This can be a tough decision, so we have created a simple survey to help guide you in the right direction. Start the survey here, or review the comprehensive resources on LLC, C-Corps &amp; <a href="https://www.govdocfiling.com/s-corporation">S-Corporation taxes</a> for each entity type under the “Start Your Business” section of the website!</p>
          <p>Depending on the type of business established, a Tax ID number will grant certain benefits unique to the business entity. With a Tax ID number, you’ll be eligible to establish a bank account in the company’s name, apply for credit, and in some instances, file income taxes separate from the business.</p>
          <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Should I&nbsp;Complete a Tax ID Application?</strong></span></p>
          <p>If you answer <em>Yes</em> to any of the following questions, you will need to file a Tax ID application:</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Are you paying income, taxes, or other wages to a non-resident alien?</li>
